
INSTALLATION FOR TESTS
- Edit "config/databases.yml" to put your database configuration
- Use SQL code from "data/sql/schema.sql" to create your database
- Make sure that paths in "web/index.php", "web/frontend_dev.php", "web/backend.php" and "web/backend_dev.php" are correct.
- Create a "cache/" and a "log/" folders in root directory and make them writable by group and others (permissions).
    -> on Linux, "mkdir cache log; chmod 777 cache; chmod 777 log"
- Make "web/flash/" and "web/uploads" folders writable by group and others (permissions).
    -> on Linux, go to "web/" folder then "chmod 777 flash; chmod 777 uploads"
- Create a symbolic link from "web/sf" to "lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"
    -> on Linux, go to "web/" folder then type "ln -s  ../lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"


IF YOUR INSTALLATION IS FOR PRODUCTION
- Follow above steps then remove "web/frontend_dev.php" and "web/backend_dev.php" (files just useful for debugging)
